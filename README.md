a way to replicate my installation between multiple machines

* This project is early alpha

* it allow declaring the state of the system then it applies that to the current system
* the idea is to have simple and user friendly API to declare everything, system and user related

* Change `configuration.rb`
* run `ruby configuration.rb`
